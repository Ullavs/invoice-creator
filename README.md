# Invoice Creator

This is a solution to a solo project from [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com).
Solo projects are meant to challenge the skills you've learnt so far through the courses; there is no solution given by Scrimba.

## The challenge

- You should make sure that there is an array that is holding the services that are requested
- Add buttons to add services to the array
- Every time something is added you should update the view below which shows what service is being added and the total price on the right
- Don't charge more than once for the same service
- The total cost should stay updated
- The button 'send invoice' should be a reset button
- Stretch goal: remove button to remove items from the task list

## Built with
